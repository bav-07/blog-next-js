Coming out of university, I knew I wanted to do software engineering, but I wasn't equipped for that yet - I had my work cut out for me.  


I started with doing online courses. Big shout out to **freeCodeCamp**, their courses are incredibly well-structured and well-written, and, alongside the multitude of brilliant **YouTube** tutorials, they also have a full **curriculum of certifications** that you can work towards, and you can pick and choose which courses are most relevant to you and your goals. Another course I started was **CS50** given by Harvard professor **David Malan**, and excellent teacher who's an expert at breaking down complex concepts into easily digestible and comprehensible ideas - I *highly* recommend this course to anyone interested in a career in computer science, especially to those new to the field and looking for a place to get started.  


Before I completed CS50 though, I ended up joining **Bright Network's Technology Academy** (BNTA), a 12-week intensive course where I would learn full-stack development. I was offered a place on the academy after having gone through numerous virtual assessments and a final assessment centre. Best of all though, unlike other coding bootcamps, this one was completely free.


So I took this opportunity of a lifetime, and through the bootcamp I managed to upskill quickly in a variety of technologies, including **Java** and **Spring Boot**, **SQL** and **Postgres**, **React**, and even **TailwindCSS** (love it or hate it, it's impact can't be ignored - more on that in a future post). The way we were taught was mostly through learning the content in lectures, then applying it in the afternoon on labs, which could be individual or paired. We also had 3 large-scale group projects through the course of 12 weeks, the final of which was a culmination of everything we learned as a full-stack project.

                                                                         

The trainers there were always ready to answer questions, to help solve errors, and greatly encouraged inquisitiveness, to push ourselves further and to embrace learning. This is only natural though, as I learned that a career in software is a career of lifelong learning, perfect for those who enjoy upskilling and developing themselves (think *growth mindset*).


Moreso than what I learned in terms of coding though, was the amazing community I become a part of. The majority of people attending the bootcamp were also coming from non-tech backgrounds, and making the leap to a career that they knew would be fulfilling for them. With all of us working towards the same goal, a strong bond between us members, Cohort 7 of BNTA, was forged. And having a community of people, a **network of like-minded individuals** who are all starting out with you, is an invaluable thing to have, especially for aspiring software engineers.


If you are starting out in your career and don't have the traditional tech-background or a CS degree, maybe a coding bootcamp could be the path for you. **However**, be warned that a bootcamp is **very challenging** and will demand a lot of your time and attention. Under normal circumstances, a bootcamp is also very expensive, although I was very fortunate to have a free bootcamp through **Bright Network**, and am very grateful for having being selected to join. I understand that not everyone is as fortunate, and I recognise my standing as one who was selected for this opportunity and who has a responsibility to make the most I can of it.


It's understandable if the costs are a barrier to bootcamps, and in that case, there are a multitude of free resources online that, if you put in the necessary time and effort, can also get you to a job-ready standing (**freeCodeCamp** as I mentioned before, as well as **The Odin Project**, both providing incredible free courses for web development). One thing to keep in mind with these free online resources, is that **you** need to hold yourself accountable for putting in the effort - or better yet, find a group of people who are working towards the same goal as you, and **hold each other accountable**.


For me personally, I felt that the bootcamp really motivated me to keep developing myself by learning more about software development and expanding my skillset. I embraced the challenges and push myself to do the best I could in the bootcamp so that I could get from it the best learning experience - *"you get out what you put in"*, another quote I heard from somewhere that seems fitting here. And I ended up coming out of it with a *Certificate of Technical Excellence*, one that I'm going to very proudly hang up on my wall (and, more importantly, put on LinkedIn).


So, to conclude, how do you land a career in software engineering with no CS degree? Well, there's no hard and fast route, but either **free online resources** or a **coding bootcamp** can be your route in, as long as you keep in mind that *neither* route is easy, and you will need to put in the effort and time to learn what you need to get that first job. It's a massive challenge, but if you know this is the field for you, and better yet, if you have a passion for it, then you can do it, I'm sure of it.


TLDR; career in software engineering with no CS degree? Do a bootcamp, or free online courses, like freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project.
