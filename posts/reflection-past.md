I went to Imperial College London, and there I studied Mechanical Engineering. It wasn't long before I realised that it wasn't truly the path for me, and, by my fourth and final year, the passion I had for the field was all but gone.


For my final year project, a 6-month long individual project that would play a massive part in my overall degree score(!), I got a project in which I would be developing a web-app. Now, this wasn't my first choice project, and I distinctly remember being worried that I, with no web-development experience prior, would struggle.


Despite having no experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, I was thrown into the deep-end, and had to adapt quickly. Using a pre-existing template to build the app, I was even using Vue.js, before having learned JavaScript - sounds crazy to me now, but at the time, I had no real idea what I was doing, so I had no perspective on what was the natural order of progression.


And in spite of the massive uphill battle to learn how to develop a front-end web-app from 0 experience - I found myself massively enjoying it, moreso than anything else I'd done at university so far. The satisfaction I got from writing out code, squashing troublesome bugs, and seeing the beautifully correct output on my screen, **activated something in my brain**. When everything fell into place and started clicking, I found myself working hours on end tweaking the app's user interface and ironing out the kinks. In the end, when the app was complete and ended up in students' hands, I felt a sense of pride that was till then foreign to me.


*"Wow. I made this."*


Not even at this point did I truly realise, that I'd already started walking down the path of software engineering. But after presenting the project, completing university and looking at my plan for the future, I found myself yearning for that same feeling of satisfaction, that indescribable, ecstatic feeling I got when coding. I think a lot of fellow coders can relate to that feeling, maybe they can put it into words better than I can. And there are those coding every day, making things they love and seeing their creations come to life.


I wanted to be one of them.


So I left the traditional path that my mechanical engineering background led me towards - and I started walking the exciting new path I discovered, the path that I decided was the right one for me.


*"The road to success is full of thorns"* - I don't know where I heard that quote from, but it feels fitting here.


*TLDR*; the web-app I made at university ignited my passion for software development, so I made the leap to this field, and here I am now!
